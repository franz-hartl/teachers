        <p>This four-week poetry unit for primary students focuses on building an appreciation of poetry. April&nbsp;is National Poetry Month, 30 days of celebrating the joy, expressiveness, and pure delight of poetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by the poem, <em>Keep a Poem in Your Pocket</em> by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, the students will begin the month-long celebration by designing a pocket to wear each day, carrying a poem with them throughout the day. Each day students will hear and learn a new poem with the goal of celebrating the diversity of poets and styles, across time and cultures.</p>
<p>(Developed for Reading, grade K; recommended for Reading, grades K-2)</p>
