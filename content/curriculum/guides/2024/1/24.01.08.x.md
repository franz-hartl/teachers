        <p>This unit focuses on debunking the misconceptions that indigenous peoples of the Americas and the Caribbean were a homogeneous group that has disappeared into the history books. This unit of study will invite my students on a journey of discovery and reflection as they are challenged to critically examine their preconceptions and assumptions about indigenous cultures. They will explore the diversity of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas and the Caribbean, focusing on creation myths as representative stories from various peoples across these regions, as well as the resilience of these communities. Students will have the opportunity to develop a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and continuities of indigenous life, as they continue to challenge the misconceptions that have obscured the vibrant histories of indigenous communities and are exposed to the persistent and enduring legacies of indigenous cultures.</p>
        <p>(Developed for United States History, grade 8, and World History, grade 7; recommended for Social Studies, Native Americans, grade 5, and English Language Art, and Mythology, grade 6)</p>
