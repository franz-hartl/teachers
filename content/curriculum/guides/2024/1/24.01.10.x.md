        <p>The History &amp; Legacy of Myth in the African &amp; Latino Diasporas unit aims to illustrate how myth, legend, and folklore have shaped and been shaped by the diasporic experience of Africans and Latinos.&nbsp; This unit is designed for the African American/Black, Puerto Rican, and Latino Studies course at the high school level, usually in grades 11-12.&nbsp; The unit could also be used in a United States history class.&nbsp; There are three anchor texts relating to the African diaspora, and three relating to the Latino diaspora.&nbsp; Teachers can choose to focus on one or both diasporas as part of the African American/Black, Puerto Rican, and Latino Studies curriculum.&nbsp; Through six suggested anchor texts, students will explore the following questions: What are myths/legends/fairy tales and why do they matter? What do they tell us?; How do people code cultural information in song? Why would people still sing these songs after the information becomes irrelevant?&nbsp; Does cultural information ever really become irrelevant?; What is cultural appropriation? Who can tell what stories? How does being an outsider to a culture change/bias/influence how a story is told?; How have indigenous religious figures interacted with the religious values of the colonizer (specifically Christianity)?&nbsp; The final project has students artistically represent how their chosen myth has changed and evolved over time and space and share their artistic representation in a roundtable format.&nbsp; Overall, this unit provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the culture(s) of these diasporas, which enhances the experience of studying these cultures in the African American/Black, Puerto Rican, and Latino Studies course.</p>
