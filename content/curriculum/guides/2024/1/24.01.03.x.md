        <p>One of the main objectives of this unit titled: Dystopian Literature: A reflection of society past and present is to analyze dystopian literature and make text to self and text to world connections. Students will be able to apply critical thinking skills when they analyze fictional dystopian literature and relate it to present day society. Students will be able to identify various themes in an array of readings.&nbsp; Students will then look to make connections with the issues, characters, and the fictional concept and if it is something that can happen &ldquo;for real!&rdquo; Students will then be given the opportunity to relate the ELA curriculum to the social studies units of study, specifically colonial American studies. As described in the unit, slavery is a prime example of dystopian life reflected in our past.&nbsp; Students will be able to research and support that statement with evidence.&nbsp; This unit will also help prepare students to engage in community service as they learn about some societal issues, how to identify the problem and then brainstorm some solutions as they prepare to move on to high school and engage with the community.</p>
