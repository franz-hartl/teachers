<p>
The focus of this unit is on activities for Sun/Earth Science Fair Projects. A teacher wishing to help guide students to complete a meaningful project can use the basic information found in this unit to provide direction for the student.
</p>
<p>
The unit tries to use ideas that have already proven successful.  The topics with related activities are:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
- Solar Energy Past and Present
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
By doing these activities, the student must research information and gather data to write a research paper about the Sun. Various Web sites are mentioned throughout the unit where a person can locate relevant information.  If one wishes to use an interdisciplinary approach, the unit can satisfy Performance Standards for Science, Math, Social Studies and Language Arts.
