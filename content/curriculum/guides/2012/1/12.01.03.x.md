  Guide Entry to 12.01.03:
 </h4>
 <p>
  Too often, male students struggle in the classroom. This unit uses images, history, and the language of art to engage students in a conversation about their positive futures. Using current research and historical paintings, most available for viewing in New Haven, this unit asks students, “What Makes a Man?” After viewing and analyzing both current and historical paintings, students will create their own portraits to show what they will become as men and women. As closure to the unit, students will present their work and new knowledge to parents and community members at a Gallery Event. Through this, struggling students are led through the process of learning: going from their own knowledge, to historical precedents and learning, to creating of new work, and finally to a presentation of this learning.
