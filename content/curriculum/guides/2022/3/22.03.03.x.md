  <p>This unit will teach students about Ethnic Studies, its history and its role in our lives. It is the study of the histories, experiences, cultures and issues of racial-ethnic groups. This unit will provide a deeper understanding that while<strong> &lsquo;</strong>race,&rsquo; as a cultural, social and historical concept has real life consequences, it does not describe human biological variation from a scientific perspective. Students will learn the history of the concept of &lsquo;race&rsquo; from a social context and what scientific researchers have to say about it. &lsquo;Race, Racism and Genetics&rsquo; uses research, lesson plans and activities to explain genetic similarity and variation. Biologically speaking, &lsquo;race&rsquo; is not real, but racism is.In this unit, students will discuss sensitive issues based on what they know about genetics and how it pertains to the social construct of &lsquo;race&rsquo; and ethnicity, including the ways in which they identify and are identified.&nbsp; Students should then be able to relate the ideas of which they are learning to the world around them in terms of controversies like &lsquo;race&rsquo; and health, &lsquo;race&rsquo; and IQ and &lsquo;race&rsquo; and sports over the course of four weeks. Students will see how &lsquo;race&rsquo; and racism is embedded in our lives and can affect our everyday thinking and relationships.</p>
