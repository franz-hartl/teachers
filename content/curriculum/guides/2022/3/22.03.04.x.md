  <p>This unit is intended for lower elementary school students to learn about the importance of their diverse community and how it was developed.&nbsp; The first few lessons focus on recognizing the Quinnipiac Tribe as the original New Haveners, which provides a bite size history of how New Haven was developed through an unbiased perspective. Through class discussions, students will come to understanding that Indigenous peoples are not simply people of the past, but present in today&rsquo;s society and ways of living, too.&nbsp; The lessons discuss how waves of immigration played a vital role in the development of the city as customs and cultures created a unique fusion over time.&nbsp; The unit encourages students to discuss and explore the importance of their community while recognizing all people as important community members.&nbsp; In this learning process, students can understand the importance of their place in society while living in unity with others by recognizing and accepting all people.</p>
