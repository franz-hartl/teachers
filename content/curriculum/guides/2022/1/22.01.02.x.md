  <p>Students will be reading the core text, Matt Dembicki&rsquo;s <em>Trickster</em>. While reading, students will examine the science in the story as well as build a stronger understanding of how setting impacts their learning and understanding. As a part of this unit, students will examine their understanding of concepts through sketchnotes. While doing so, students are asked also to consider the role oral storytelling plays in understanding a text. The culminating activity in the unit asks students to create their own story in the style of Native American origin stories.</p>
