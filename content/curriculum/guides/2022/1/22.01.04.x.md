<p>This unit is a progressive art unit that combines hands-on art foundations, S.T.E.A.M. contents,&nbsp; and mindful practices, all while engaging in the growing world of technology communications. It is scientifically proven that students learn best when they feel connected and can see real world connections.&nbsp; Revealing the appearance of spiral forms in nature, art, science, technology, and math, I suggest how this unit on spirals may be adapted for each age group from PreK to Grade 12, with their very different developmental learning needs.&nbsp; I provide a detailed account of the unit&rsquo;s design for a focus group of middle-school students (Grades 5-8).&nbsp; I have included a spiral slideshow that is a working slideshow document, hours upon hours of intellectual property for you to share and enjoy with classrooms all over the world. I am passionate about students' love for learning and I believe this unit is transformative in changing the approaches to teaching and learning.</p>
