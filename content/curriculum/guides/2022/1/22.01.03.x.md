<p>This eight-lesson unit was designed to introduce elementary students to the impact severe weather has on an area.&nbsp; Specifically, students will be able to describe climate and identify how it affects a particular area or region of the world. &nbsp;They will be able to look at different weather systems and patterns that impact daily life for all living things.&nbsp; Additionally, students will be able to understand the five different climate zones categorized by the K&ouml;ppen-Geiger Climate Classification System.</p>

<p>Within the unit, students will also have the opportunity to observe weather by creating a sit spot for daily observation both at home and at school.&nbsp; They will also be able to participate in many different hands-on activities such as meeting a meteorologist and learning what their daily tasks involve; visiting the Connecticut Science Center; and measuring the weather and creating a rain gauge. Ultimately, the goal of this unit is for students to understand how weather and climate impact living things and how to prepare and stay safe during extreme weather.</p>
