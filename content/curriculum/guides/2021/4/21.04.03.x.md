<main>
        <p>This unit is designed to help middle school students develop an understanding of rates, ratios, proportions, percents; as well as proportional relationships, unit rates, slope, linear equations, and exponential equations; and to understand how to use their mathematical knowledge to interpret and understand global warming.&nbsp; Students will use math modeling to make predictions about the future of global warming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unit is written with the intent of investigating global warming, and then teaching math topics to help students analyze what they are learning.&nbsp; There is some incidental cross-curricular teaching of NGSS standards.</p>
<p>(Developed for Math, grades 7-8, and Pre-Algebra, grade 8; recommended for Math, grades 6-7, and Pre-Algebra and Algebra, grade 8)</p>
