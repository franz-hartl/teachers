        <p>This unit is written for teachers with climate change in their curriculum and English Language Learners in their classroom. Written to be taught at a large high school in New Haven CT with block scheduling, teachers may use this unit to inform themselves on climate change and for some ideas for labs that help demonstrate the science behind a warmer world. Also provided here are some general teaching strategies to help students learning English grasp the science and the English language.</p>
<p>Climate change is the major environmental issue of the day and we are already feeling the effects of a warmer world. Effects include but are not limited to more severe storms, floods, droughts and sea level rise. It is important for students to learn why this is happening and what caused it but also what can be done about it. All students deserve to learn about the changes to the world that directly impact them.</p>
