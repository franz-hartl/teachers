        <p>Climate change is an important topic to introduce to students of all ages.&nbsp; For many students, it is difficult to make the connection between climate and the direct impacts on their health.&nbsp; This unit aims to demonstrate the interconnection between disease and changes in local climates in Connecticut.&nbsp; There are several indicators of climate change that are explored including the increase in global temperature, changes to the first and last frost dates, impacts of sea surface temperature, and thawing of glaciers and permafrost.&nbsp; These climate change symptoms have caused expanded ranges of vectors for disease transmission, changes in allergy seasons, and increases in heat-related illnesses.&nbsp; This unit is designed to be implemented whole or in part in a variety of courses including physical-chemistry, chemistry, environmental science, biology, or anatomy courses.&nbsp; The suggested activities can also be adjusted to fit some middle school science curriculum and high school science curriculum.</p>
<p>(Developed for Anatomy, grades 11-12, and Biology, grade 10; recommended for Physics-Chemistry, grade 9; Biology, grade 10; Chemistry, grade 11; and Environmental Science electives)</p>
