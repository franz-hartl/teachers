        <p><span>The science of Earth&rsquo;s global climate system and the responsibilities that all humans share as protective caretakers of our planet are important for every person to understand.&nbsp; We all have a vested interest in our planet because Earth is our only home.&nbsp; People have been observing, questioning, and analyzing collected information about the history of the Earth ever since the earliest humans first wondered about the world around them.&nbsp; Learning from the past is a smart and logical way to prepare for the future.</span></p>
<p><span>This unit will help 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> grade teachers prepare students to explore two big questions related to the Earth&rsquo;s changing climate.&nbsp; The primary goal is to nurture an understanding of the element carbon, Earth&rsquo;s carbon cycle, and how carbon dioxide and other gases contribute to the planet warming greenhouse effect of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.&nbsp; The questions are:</span></p>
<p><span>1) What is carbon and why are all living things on Earth considered to be carbon-based lifeforms? </span></p>
<p><span>2) What is the greenhouse effect and why should we care about how much carbon is in our atmosphere? </span></p>
<p><span>These questions align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for 4<sup>th</sup> grade that many states have adopted or adapted.</span></p>
<p>(Developed for Elementary Science, grade 4; recommended for Elementary Science, grade 4)</p>
