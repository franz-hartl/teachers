        <p><span>The study of genocide has always been a major focus of study within many classrooms across the country. Keeping that in mind, the lessons within this unit set out not only to provide the teacher with materials, but to create a more enriched understanding of early twentieth century genocides to their students. In addition, the unit allows for students to foster a deeper understanding of events through mapping and critical thinking exercises. It is through the use of maps that students will be able to think about genocide on a deeper level, by creating a mind map of what someone who experienced genocide felt to creating a map of a town pre- and post- genocide. It is through these activities that students will be able to place themselves in the mindset of individuals impacted by genocide and make a deeper connection to the material as a result. </span></p>
