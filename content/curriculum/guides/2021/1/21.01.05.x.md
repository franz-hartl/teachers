        <p><span>Students will be reading the core text <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>. While reading, students will examine the text from the lens of the writer Lorraine Hansberry&rsquo;s political beliefs. One lens students will use in their examination of the work is Edward De Bono&rsquo;s Six Hats method to think deeper about various forms of texts including art, media, and traditional text. While doing so, students are asked to think about the motivations of the creators and the impact the work has in terms of the creator&rsquo;s view on particular social movements. The culminating activity in the unit asks students to create their own piece of art to be observed and reflected upon by their peers.</span></p>
