<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.03.10:
</h4>
        <p>The author has written a unit which takes a period from the history of India and coupled it with a study of Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s <em>The Man Who Would Be King. </em>The result is a challenging unit for eighth-grade students. The writing process for this unit encompassed studies in the short story through the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and a seminar at Oxford University on British Foreign Policy. The study at Oxford was made possible through a grant from the English Speaking Union of New Haven and Southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>The unit treats the literature and history sections separately, yet attempts to bridge the two in the strategies section.</p>
<p>(Developed for Reading, grade 8; recommended for History and Literature, grade 8)</p>
