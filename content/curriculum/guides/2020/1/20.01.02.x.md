        <p><span>In this unit, students will study a variety of female authors who&rsquo;s work delves into social issues that are important to them and their world. While examining the works of these women, the students will be asked to consider the author&rsquo;s background in determining why this issue might be important. In the process of exploring the works of others, the students will be asked to respond to the readings by using the self directed writing strategy. At the end of the unit, the students will produce a culminating piece based on the writing they&rsquo;ve done throughout the unit. Overall, the purpose of my unit is for students to find their own voice to express what is important to them.</span></p>
