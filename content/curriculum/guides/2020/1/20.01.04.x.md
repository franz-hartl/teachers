        <p>As<span> students outgrow family and cultural expectations that have already predetermined their future, these topics have become more urgent in the classroom.&nbsp; Depending on the structure of their family, these expectations may be based on outdated traditions that may need to be abandoned because they are a mismatch for young generations.&nbsp; Therefore, the priority goal for this unit is to fuel the next generation to maintain and establish expectations that best suit them.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Reflection on personal identity will enable students to identify, confront, analyze, and critique gender stereotypes in Sandra Cisneros&rsquo; coming-of-age novel, <em>The House on Mango Street</em>.&nbsp; The characters represent an assortment of struggles and past experiences that will naturally foster personal connections and engage students in student-led discussions. </span></p>
<p><span>Each lesson in this unit will serve as a checkpoint for students to continuously work toward their own definition of identity.&nbsp; Connecting the reading to students&rsquo; embeddedness in family will help them see the importance of being thankful, despite adversity.&nbsp; Most favorably, students will learn how to give back, beginning with those who have helped them.</span></p>
