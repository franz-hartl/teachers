        <p><span>Through work in this unit, students should come away with connections between societies&mdash;namely the United States and South Africa.&nbsp; This unit was designed to expand the knowledge of students about the rich history of Africa, which is often not taught in depth or glossed over.&nbsp; Usually the focus of units on Africa stay centered on ancient Egypt, its pharaohs and rich natural resources.&nbsp; Time to give in-depth instruction is missing and the results are ill-prepared history / Social Studies students.&nbsp; Designed to allow students to view or learn about the country that they live in and relate it to the experiences of those who lived on another continent.&nbsp; It is the hope that students will not see the history of their country or Africa (South Africa) as being isolated or totally foreign.&nbsp; While the languages that we speak in society or throughout the world may be different, many people have or have had similar experiences&mdash;some of which occur today.&nbsp; This unit allow opportunities for extended learning that is crucial to understanding African history beyond learning about the Egyptian culture, ancient hieroglyphics and the Nile River.&nbsp; Learners will also analyze the development of &ldquo;peoples,&rdquo; systemic racism and the influences of government and society on its people.&nbsp; Most importantly, this unit will allow for an in-depth study of Apartheid in South Africa through a careful study of women in the Anti-Apartheid and Civil Rights Movements. </span></p>
