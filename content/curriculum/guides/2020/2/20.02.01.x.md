        <p>The main ideas behind this unit include (1) to introduce the concepts of biological molecules, their structure, function, and the types of food that contain these molecules, (2) to understand how different living organisms obtain their food and convert it into energy that they need for survival, (3) to introduce the importance of reading the Nutritional Facts Labels and understanding the valuable information in the labels about the foods that we consume, and (4) to utilize the My Plate Concept to emphasize the importance of a balanced diet and create menus that are catered to students&rsquo; daily energy needs. Inner-city students could be tremendously benefitted from the My Plate concept as it will help them make healthy food choices and maintain healthy lifestyles. This unit can be modified for students at middle-school and elementary-school levels. The content knowledge in this unit couples with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) practices, such as asking questions, conducting research, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, finding answers to questions, and designing solutions. The unit thus addresses the New Haven Public School District, the State of Connecticut, and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).</p>
