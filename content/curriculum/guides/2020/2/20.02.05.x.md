        <p>This five-lesson unit was designed to introduce elementary students to the basic chemistry behind making playdough as they take on the role of a chemical engineer and endeavor to develop a process (or recipe) for making playdough.&nbsp; Moreover, it will inject fundamental knowledge of chemistry. Students will use this knowledge to improve consistency in producing high-quality playdough comparable to retail brand &ldquo;Play-Doh&rdquo; in texture, elasticity, and pliability.&nbsp; Along the way, students will learn the role of each ingredient and the reasoning behind each step of the process (mixing, kneading, and applying heat).&nbsp; There will also be room for experimentation as students explore various ingredients and/or different preparation processes.&nbsp; Students will record their measured ingredients and procedures used for each batch in a chemical engineering journal and present their best final product to the class.&nbsp; The unit promotes an introduction to chemistry and engineering, and using an organized method to record notes and observations.&nbsp; Not only that, but making playdough is a lot of fun!&nbsp; Fair warning &ndash; students will be excited, and some results may come out sticky and messy!&nbsp; The unit is designed to take five one-hour sessions but can be extended or shortened at the discretion of the teacher.</p>
<p>(Developed for STEM Lab, grade 2; recommended for Science, grades K-5)</p>
