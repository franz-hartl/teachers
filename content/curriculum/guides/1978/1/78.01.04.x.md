  Guide Entry to 78.01.04:
 </h4>
 The use of poetry in the classroom becomes the main vehicle for enhancing students’ personal growth. This unit is a reaction to and study of the relationship between poetry and the process of emotional and intellectual maturity. Heavy emphasis is placed on the theories and material present in Kenneth Koch’s books on teaching poetry to young children. Written as a continuous narrative, the unit blends background material, numerous examples of poetry, and descriptions of specific classroom strategies and activities that will engage high school students.
