 <h4>
  Guide Entry to 78.03.02:
 </h4>
 With all our modern technological advances we still have been unable to overcome the prejudice of human beings toward other human beings. This unit devotes a large portion of the narrative to the development of a comprehensive definition of the many forms and effects of prejudice.  A major objective is to make students more aware of the fact that race, religion, and nationality do not make one person superior or inferior to another.  A variety of techniques that should broaden studentsâ€™ understanding is suggested and then incorporated into the course outline.  Three sample lesson plans are included as well as a list of student activities.  Bibliographies, resource lists, and addresses for further information conclude the unit.

  (Recommended for use in the Social Studies classrooms in both Middle and High Schools; no specific time frame is suggested)
