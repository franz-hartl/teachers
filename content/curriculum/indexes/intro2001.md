<b>Foreword</b>
</p><p>Since
the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute began its work in 1978, hundreds of
teaching units have been prepared by dozens of teachers on scores of
themes.  The 143 volumes containing the teaching units are a treasure
trove of ideas and procedures for teaching English, History, Social
Studies, the Languages, the Arts, Mathematics, and Science in elementary,
middle, and high schools.  A list of these volumes appears on the
<a href="../units/">Directory of Volumes</a> page of this website.
The very bulk of the material, however, made it somewhat
tiresome to search through all the volumes to unearth the gems of special
interest to the searcher.  Therefore, in the summer of l985, James Vivian,
Director of the Institute, commissioned the preparation of a topical index
to all units written from 1978 through 1985.  In 1986, 1989, 1990, 1992,
1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 the units written more
recently were added. The
result of that original commission and the subsequent updates follow over
the next pages.
</p><p>First a defining word or two and then a suggestion
about using the index.
</p><p>Each teaching unit is designated by three
two-digit numbers.  For example, the form "89.05.01" refers to the year
the unit was written (1989), the volume number (5) for the seminar in
which the unit was developed, and the chapter (1) in that volume where the
unit appears.  The indexers decided not to indicate whether the units were
primarily for elementary school, middle school, or for high school
classes.  It has seemed—and teachers have often said—that a
great many of the units, regardless of their originally intended audience,
are readily adaptable for use across a wide range of grades.
</p><p>To make
the index easier to use, four typefaces differentiate among main
categories and their subheadings.  Major headings appear in
large boldface
type; minor headings are in italics; first 
subheadings are in standard typeface; and second subheadings are
in bold italic type.  An example is provided 
below:</p><p> 
<font size="+1"><b>Art</b></font><br/>
<font color="#ffffff" style="visibility:hidden;">........</font><i>Painting</i><br/>
<font color="#ffffff" style="visibility:hidden;">................</font>American<br/>
<font color="#ffffff" style="visibility:hidden;">........................</font>
<font size="-1"><b><i>Hopper, Edward</i></b></font><br/>
<font color="#ffffff" style="visibility:hidden;">................................</font>
<font size="-1"><a href="../guides/1989/5/89.05.01.x.html">89.05.01</a></font><br/>
</p><p>                    Now a suggestion.  No index can be prepared to
everyone's satisfaction, especially with regard to the number of specific
topical entries and with regard to cross-referencing.  The index that
follows has assumed an open and explorative reader.  Take only one
example.  The number of entries under "Connecticut" may seem surprisingly
low; however, there are relevant entries under "New Haven CT" and under
several disciplinary headings (e.g. Ecology).  We urge the users of the
index to take an open attitude in searching the index for units of
interest to them.  The alternative, the indexers feared, would be an index
so long and cumbersome as seriously to reduce its usefulness.  For
instance, almost all units present exercises on Reading, Writing, and
Teaching Methods, but we have refrained from listing all units under
those encompassing headings.
</p><p>New approaches to subjects along
with their new terminologies somewhat complicate the search process.  The
1996 index, for example, introduced the major heading of
"Multiculturalism," an increasingly common term in a variety of contexts. 
As all the units under that heading date from 1996 through 2000, a hasty
search may give the impression
that the Institute has produced no units pertaining to multiculturalism
prior to 1996, which is most definitely not the case.  (Consider the
forthcoming publication of a specialized reference list of over 300
Institute units on teaching about diversity.) Many older units which would
be indexed under "Multiculturalism" today can be found by searching the
appropriate subheadings under "Art," "Ethnicity," "History," and
"Literature," among others.  Again, we recommend that users of this index
should search under several key words and be alert to the shifting of
terminologies over time.  Because the index is a constantly growing
document, we invite all comments to help the indexers continue to build
the most useful list they can.
</p><p>Copies of the curriculum units indexed
here are deposited in all New Haven public school libraries; related
materials for classroom use may be obtained by contacting the Teacher
Institute School Representatives.  Guides to the units written in each
year and reference lists showing the relationship of the units to school
curricula are also available from the Institute.  An electronic version of
these curricular resources—including this index—is accessible by
connecting to the Institute's World Wide Web site
(<a href="..\..\">http://teachersinstitute.yale.edu</a>).
</p><p>Finally, then, a word of appreciation to
all the individuals who have worked on the index:  Ellen Barber, Margaret
Davey, Donna Del Buco, Jeff Dolven, Carla Eckhardt, William Kessen, David
Leonhardt, John Long, John R. Savoie, and Dawn Volkman.
