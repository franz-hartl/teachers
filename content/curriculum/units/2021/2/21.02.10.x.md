	<p>Social Studies is the study of the interactions of people, events, geography, economics, and society.&nbsp; What happens when the training and content that many history and social studies teachers have used contains deep fault line fissures and misrepresentations?&nbsp; In this four to six-week curriculum unit designed for 8<sup>th</sup> graders, students will explore and research events in history from 1910 to the 1970s.&nbsp; Many of these events are rarely mentioned in most Social Studies textbooks, curricula, or resources.</p>
<p>Essential questions for this unit are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How can social studies investigate a history of racism?</li>
<li>What is anti-racist education?</li>
<li>How can educators and students work to remix our current social studies curriculum to emphasize anti-racist learning?</li>
<li>How are people affected by marginalization and erasure?</li>
<li>How does a dominant narrative develop?</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will engage in viewing and researching videos and artifacts about thriving black communities that developed in the early 20th century amidst the violence of Jim Crow.&nbsp; The dominant narrative about US History from the end of Reconstruction to the mid-20th century has often portrayed Black people as hopeless and destitute.&nbsp; In reality, many Black people left the south, moved north or Midwest to establish flourishing communities.&nbsp; Black communities in Tulsa, Knoxville and Chicago were making great progress in the first two decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. But during the Red Summer of 1919, the aforementioned communities and others were burned down by white mobs and never rebuilt.&nbsp; One community was burned down and filled in with water, later becoming a lake.&nbsp; These mobs murdered blacks, decimated their townships, and then attempted to conceal this history, often erasing it entirely from history books.</p>
<p>Students&rsquo; culminating project is research, documentation, and presentation of their findings through a student-led Community Action Event.</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>History cannot be experienced if it is not noted or passed down. As a student, I experienced my teachers talk in truth, depth, or equity about African Americans or those of Latinx or indigenous backgrounds.&nbsp; It was not until college that my eyes were partially opened, and I felt that I too mattered and that my people had major roles in the formation of America.</p>
<p>I am a teacher at an inner-city, magnet-themed school for the New Haven Public School District located in New Haven, Connecticut.&nbsp; Most of my years as an educator were spent as an English Language Arts teacher with experiences in curriculum and instruction, administration, and journalism.&nbsp; My school serves more than 700 students in grades Pre-k-8, from urban and neighborhood communities with some suburban students from surrounding towns.</p>
<p>As a Social Studies teacher to students in grades seven and eight I have discovered through my experiences that my discipline has intentionally limited or erased information that is part of American history.&nbsp; The foundation of Social Studies curriculum fosters racism.&nbsp; History and Social Studies educators must go beyond teaching students to memorize dates and the causes of war.&nbsp; They must instead remix their curriculum and make adjustments, to create anti-racist Social Studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year as I began reflecting on the 2020 curricular topic for YNTI, it had become evident that more than ever before the practice and acceptance of systemic racism was being challenged.&nbsp; The tally sheet on whether there were measurable and consistent &ldquo;gains&rdquo; made during the Civil Rights Movement that still exist today were also being examined.&nbsp; There had not been this force of world-wide voices who discussed these issues so loudly since the 1960s.&nbsp; However, when looking through the anti-racist lens you discover that these issues have been brought to the forefront, perhaps by singular voices like those of James Baldwin who began to call out the educational system for its practices more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Progressing through elementary, middle, and high school I rarely heard my teachers talk in truth, depth, or equity about the experiences of brown and black people.&nbsp; People of color have often felt that they had no part in the history that they learn about in school.&nbsp; For most students, their entry into middle school and high school are limited to historic facts focused on slavery, black inventors, and civil rights era highlights.&nbsp; This implicitly communicates strongly that black and brown students strongly to black and brown students that their accomplishments and contributions to society have had little or no value.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, the persistent results of the dominant group&rsquo;s actions are to devalue and dehumanize the contributions of those who are not classified as a part of the dominant group.&nbsp; I call it erasure or the state of being invisible.</p>
<p>In turn our teachers, need to be able to identify racial holes or places where they discover the curriculum has conveniently left out the voice and even actual real historical experiences of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people.&nbsp; Finally, teachers must be made to feel comfortable and confident in addressing and shoring up the weakened places in their curriculums.</p>
<p>In his paper called, A Talk to Teachers,&rdquo; writer James Baldwin tells his audience, &ldquo;&hellip;you must understand that in the attempt to correct so many generations of bad faith and cruelty, when it is operating not only in the classroom but in society, you will meet the most fantastic, the most brutal, and the most determined resistance. There is no point in pretending that this won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baldwin is known as prolific writer of African American heritage who decried racial injustice through interviews, novels and articles and stated that white America&rsquo;s claims to whiteness were flawed, inaccurate and baseless. With everything that Americans learn about during their educational journey the dominant group has constructed a system that devalues, debases, erases, ignores and disrupts the narratives of brown and black people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such example is the 1921 Race Massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma&mdash;this event has rarely made it into history books or any student textbooks.&nbsp; In Tulsa&rsquo;s, all black, Greenwood section on May 31 a white mob attacked black residents and burned down their homes and businesses.&nbsp; A church, a library, schools, doctor&rsquo;s offices, law offices, more than 200 businesses, and homes belonging to more than 10,000 people were destroyed and or torched.&nbsp; Of that 10,000 -- all of whom were black were displaced and forced to become refugees after being expelled from their lands, homes, and businesses.&nbsp; At least 300 blacks and approximately 30 whites were killed, although the actual numbers have varied over the years. According to the documentary titled "Tulsa 1921: An American Tragedy," planes flew over the area dropping kerosene, nitroglycerin and turpentine bombs as whites below set fire to homes&mdash;even killing black residents who tried to escape.&nbsp; The two-day event was started because someone reported that a white woman, Sarah Page, was screaming in an elevator as saw a young black man leaving.&nbsp; Page did not go on record making the complaint against the young man.&nbsp; Family members of the young man said that they were actually friends and were possibly dating and other reports that he possibly bumped into her.&nbsp; By the end of the rampage on June 1, the 35 square blocks of what was originally called &ldquo;Negro Wall Street&rdquo; by Booker T. Washington, were leveled, and burned.&nbsp; Professor Karlos Hill, from the University of Oklahoma, described it as an &ldquo;intentional and systematic&hellip; military-styled assault on a civilian community.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Rationale: Curricular holes, erasures, and missteps in the education of students of color</strong></h2>
<p><em>&ldquo;The only way to undo racism is to consistently identify it and describe it&mdash;and then dismantle it.&rdquo; &ndash;Ibram X. Kendi</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It is a peculiar sensation, this double consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others. &hellip; One ever feels his twoness &mdash; an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&mdash;W.E.B. Du Bois, sociologist, historian, activist, 1897</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The chasm between the principles upon which this Government was founded ... and those which are daily practiced under the protection of the flag, yawns so wide and deep.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&mdash;Mary Church Terrell, clubwoman, businesswoman, activist, 1906</em></p>
<p>The public school system is fraught with inconsistencies, inequities, racist rhetoric, and practices &ndash; from the curriculum, materials and resources, testing tools, suspensions, parental contact practices and more.&nbsp; As educators we must actively implement ways to remix our curriculum -- even to the extent of disrupting the traditional thinking.&nbsp; Anti-racist curriculum and pedagogy forces its participants to delve deeper than the typical or ordinary expansion of multicultural items into a curriculum.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allowing&rdquo; the expression of multiculturalism is racist.&nbsp; When people of color experience &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; of existence or &ldquo;celebratory or recognition&rdquo; days by the majority is the norm, racism, perhaps not intentional, is at the core.</p>
<h3>Racism in the curriculum can be found in the following ways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social Studies Curriculum have historically promoted racist practices leading to the silencing of people of color who are disenfranchised.</li>
<li>The baseline of what we know and have been taught as students and teachers can be disruptive to the true accurate account of history and events that represent all. Students, communities, and educators that have predominantly benefited from white privilege are sometimes unable to recognize longstanding institutional malpractice or the racist mindsets that often accompany those practices.</li>
<li>From the time of the colonists there were the actions of patriarchal dominants which were involved in stealing land from the Indigenous people. That same thing has repeated throughout history where &ldquo;incidences&rdquo; were used to burn down neighborhoods and push blacks out of the land they owned.</li>
<li>History books have demonstrated expansion and growth of white colonials and westward expansionists as normal. However, the acceptance of land-grabbing as expansion is reproduces inequality.</li>
<li>Blacks were kept out of suburban neighborhoods after the Jim Crow Era into the 1980s. An example of this is in Chicago where the dominant residents used something called restrictive covenants&mdash;also known as blockbusting.&nbsp; Often city officials and regulations allowed these practices. For example, after the destruction of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma laws and zoning regulations kept its former inhabitants and landowners from rebuilding on the land.</li>
<li>Irregularities whether it be from living conditions to disparaged neighborhoods and resources&mdash;the dominant white group has set up the system to communicate through a variety of vehicles (legislation, silence, erasure, etc.) the needs of minorities are addressed after theirs.</li>
<li>Social Studies and other content areas do not create or support equality for all of its students. Instead, it is a system that has been set up from its inception to keep the races divided and to diminish the black and brown people.</li>
<li>The silent majority behind all the world systems represents the white man and then the white race. This system seeks to keep land and knowledge out of the hands of the non-minority.&nbsp; Practices that create hierarchies and levels to be reached whether in the army, education, careers, medical field, psychology, economics and more exist.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Being colorblind or claiming not to see color is racist.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my hope for other teachers and even students to experience American history as it really occurred and not in that matter that it was ghost written or edited.</p>
<h2><strong>The Unit</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of the unit is to assist educators as they take a closer look at their curricula.&nbsp; Through this unit educators will look at the content and educational practices, curricula and resources that perpetuated an incorrect dominant narrative which in turn separated and divided.&nbsp; The major focus of this unit will be on the communities of blacks that were established across North America from 1916 to as late as 1970.&nbsp; During the Great Migration, which is known as.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Black Migration or the Great Northward Migration was characterized by the mass movement or relocation of more than 6 million African Americans from the South to the North, Midwest, and West from about 1910 to 1970. &nbsp;Many of these people of color made choices to try to find better economic opportunities in the midst of Jim Crow and unsaid sets of restrictions.&nbsp; Blacks left to set up extraordinarily successful black communities -- &ldquo;Black Wall Street,&rdquo; also known as Greenwood or The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921.&nbsp; According to the cnbc.com article &ldquo;Black Wall Street&rsquo;: The history of the wealthy Black community and the massacre perpetrated there 100 years ago,&rdquo; the event is described as a &ldquo;tragic event perpetrated on Black Wall Street that has been described as &lsquo;the single worst incident of racial violence in American history.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My district&rsquo;s eighth-grade curriculum is centered around the United States up through the Civil Rights era.&nbsp; This unit will use the tools of narratives, art, pictures, and other artifacts to demonstrate how educators and students can research and tell the stories of their thriving local community as well as discovering the story of Greenwood in Tulsa and other communities and events that have been left out of history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout this unit there will be many opportunities to intersperse and bring out parts of history that will allow Black, Brown and those considered &ldquo;Other&rdquo; to find themselves and their events in our classrooms, but most importantly exposing teachers to ways that they can fully flush out their curriculum.&nbsp; This unit would allow teachers to intersect narratives and resources and interrupt the widely accepted and flawed Social Studies Curriculum, outdated social studies textbooks still used in in many classrooms.&nbsp; Some classrooms do not have textbooks, but do not access digital technology and may be run by people who &ldquo;know&rdquo; history and have taught the course for 10-20 years.&nbsp; The Social Studies classroom has become a time capsule&mdash;never pried open to exchange the artifacts on the shelves&mdash;remaining frozen in time and existing apart from the world that encapsulates it.</p>
<h2><strong>Anti-racist Social Studies Curriculum </strong></h2>
<p>Educators must ask themselves, &ldquo;What needs to be undone in the way they relate to students, parents, administrators?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Anti-racist history educator&mdash;Pedagogy, curriculum, and practice</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Narratives &ndash; The use of personal narratives with our students or introducing the narratives of others in history is powerful. It is difficult to deny the personal experiences and history directly through the lives of others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to People&rsquo;s History Classroom in section titled Unsung Heroes educators should analyze movements for change and acknowledge and accept errors, erasures and mishandlings of peoples and events from history or the very curriculum that we teach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adjusting the way that we teach items in singularity&mdash;taking black heroes off their pedestals and placing them in context in history of the American/World or societal timeline so that they belong to an event or experience. Teaching items in singleness creates a &ldquo;celebratory&rdquo; viewpoint.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Social Media - join/ follow groups or educational organizations that cover and explore social justice, culturally relevant pedagogy like:</li>

<h2><strong>Questions for Consideration as you review your Social Studies Curriculum:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>How can anti-racism be taught through the regular lens/component in my curriculum?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between isolated and systemic racism?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is racial socialization?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What do your students believe about themselves about their race? Other races?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What messages do your school and school district communicate about race?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can racism in the United States of America be considered or turn into homegrown terrorism?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How has the system of taking already owned privileges and land become hidden racism?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do many students who learn about black history freeze all black history to the time of slavery or only think that blacks in history are isolated to the time of slavery?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What are simple steps that teachers can take to make identify racist sections or blind spots in their curricula?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What do you do when students believe the false narrative?&nbsp; How do you combat the false with personal narratives and experiences or events from other people?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How can you as the educator, interrupt the inequities?</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Enduring understandings for Teachers using this unit:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>There must be equal time and space given to understand the components of Critical Race Theory and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Racial identity is externally determined (What others think about me?) as well as determined by the individual (What do I think about myself?)</li>
<li><strong> </strong>We as teachers and even curriculum or practices often communicate a hidden or unspoken curriculum or set of expectations.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Power is not equal for all and not equally distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Enduring understandings for students:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Power is not equal for all and not equally distributed.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Racial identity is externally determined (What others think about me?) as well as determined by the individual (What do I think about myself?)</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Ways to Remix Your Curriculum for Anti-Racist Curriculum</strong></h2>

<p>Goals/Learning Targets (Unless specifically noted within each lesson, the following objectives will apply to lessons):</p>
<ul>
<li>identify and analyze events in American History.</li>
<li>identify and analyze the impact of the events on groupings of people of different races.</li>
<li>identify and analyze the improprieties in the event</li>
<li>identify and analyze the concept of power (social, economic, political)</li>
<li>discuss the impact of the elimination or erasure of factual events from history books and educational resources</li>
<li>develop or create solutions to counter the elimination or erasure of factual events from history books and educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><strong>Suggested Activities </strong></h3>
<h4>ERACE Search project-</h4>
<p>Explanation: The title of the assignment was created to demonstrate that race is something that is seen while the dominant narrative claims colorblindness.&nbsp; With no logical way to erase race --there are many ways to learn about a group of people who do not share the same culture as you and their place in history.&nbsp; The word tolerance should not come up as students begin their learning or exploration.</p>
<p>What our students find should steer away from the dominant narrative&rsquo;s spotlight or especially accepted majority focus or acceptance of the role of people in &ldquo;slavery.&rdquo;&nbsp; What students discover should dismantle and disrupt common stereotypes and the dominant narrative.</p>
<h4>Activity One - Hidden Treasures</h4>
<p>This project requires the students and teacher to work together to present possible research targets for students.&nbsp; A list of events and communities in your local area or across the United States will be the launching point for this assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning for the Research <em>(Time needed 1 &ndash; 2 Days)</em> - Develop the list for the ERACE search - Either the teacher or a set of students to compile the research target list well in advance of the assignment.</li>
<li>Research Begins - New Haven&rsquo;s Hidden Treasures - Students groups will research the following topics, events, and individuals from New Haven during the 1920s &ndash; 1970s and present their information to their school community.
<ul>
<li>Research to be assigned by decade or sections of years</li>
<li>Research to be assigned by topics
<ul>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>Activists
<ul>
<li>Social Justice / Issues of Race</li>
<li>Gender Justice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Heroes/Heroines</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Court / Law / Government</li>
<li>Architects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The information discovered should be kept in a digital repository, website, etc. Students will be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the digital repository.&nbsp; When the class of students promote to the next grade the incoming class of students will maintain and upgrade/upload new information.&nbsp; The teacher will serve as the coordinator of the project.</li>
<li>Community forum - Community Forum for students to present their ERACE research to leaders in the community (the mayor, university leaders, state and local political leaders, board of education members, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson: Discovering History with the Social Studies Curriculum</h3>
<p>Purpose -Students will analyze events in history and identify them within their school&rsquo;s / curricular resources.&nbsp; Students will be asked to make judgements about historical events and the resources students have access to.</p>
<h4>Key vocabulary and terms for this lesson</h4>
<p>Critical Race Theory (CRT) - is a movement started by the late Derek Bell, civil-rights attorney, who was the first Black professor to earn tenure at Harvard Law School. The movement was originally started as a way to show how white supremacy has foundations in law, culture and politics and continues to be replicated in America.&nbsp; It is part of American life and society &ndash;this foundational racism cannot be legislated.&nbsp; With CRT&rsquo;s tenets is that any given culture creates its own reality in its own self-interest.&nbsp; Because of this minorities needs, or interests are not acknowledged or come after the needs of the dominant group.&nbsp; This system created by and for white elites, will allow racial advancement for minorities if they benefit from it.</p>
<p>Culturally Relevant Pedagogy &ndash; a model that centers on numerous points of student achievement and supports students to uphold their cultural identities while allowing them to develop multiple perspectives to address and challenge racial and societal disparities.</p>
<p>Racial Stratification - Racial and ethnic stratification is hierarchy or systems of inequality that benefit fixed groups based on membership of race or national origin.&nbsp; It also produces social ranking and degrees of rewards for belonging to that fixed member group</p>
<p>Positive Racial Identity &ndash; According to Carnegie Library, positive racial identity is the positive beliefs and attitudes about belonging to one&rsquo;s racial group.&nbsp;  Positive racial and ethnic identity has been linked to higher resilience, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and school grades.</p>
<p>White Supremacy- the belief that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races (Merriam-Webster)</p>
<p>White Privilege- special treatment or advantages possessed or experienced by a white person because of their race in a society characterized by racial inequality and discrimination. (Oxford Dictionary)</p>
<p>White Fragility- discomfort and defensiveness on the part of a white person when confronted by information about racial inequality and injustice. (Merriam-Webster)</p>
<p>Hidden&nbsp;curriculum &ndash; the&nbsp;unwritten, unsaid, lessons, values, and perspectives that students learn in school or work communities follow.</p>
<h4>Key vocabulary and terms for students</h4>
<p>White Supremacy - the belief that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races (Merriam-Webster)</p>
<p>Racism - unfair treatment of people of a particular race in a society especially to the benefit of people of another race; the belief that certain races of people are superior to others</p>
<p>Ethnicity - group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion, or language</p>
<h4>Teacher Resource for this lesson</h4>
<p>Change the Narrative - World renowned Novelist Chimamanda Adichie in her TED Talks, &ldquo;The danger of a single story,&rdquo; discussed how important it is for more than one narrative, story, source to be told or used.&nbsp; Adichie talked about using or writing about the things that our students (population) recognize.&nbsp; Having the single impression or understanding of a group a people can be detrimental resulting in a default patronizing outlook of pity or unconsciously identifying people with a sub-standard view of their humanity.</p>
<h4>Activity one</h4>
<p>Using the title of one of the videos, &nbsp;for example, &ldquo;Tulsa 1921: An American Tragedy,&rdquo; ask students to make predictions about contents of the video.</p>
<p>Material: T-Chart photocopy or use computers</p>
<p>Directions:&nbsp; In a T-chart on the left side have students write their predictions.&nbsp; Next show the video,&rdquo; Tulsa 1921: An American Tragedy,&rdquo; and ask students to document their observations using words, symbols and pictures or drawings on the right side of the T-chart.</p>
<p>VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbuPdkI434 "Tulsa 1921: An American Tragedy" June 2, 2021 (43 minutes 55 seconds)</p>
<ul>
<li>After viewing the video(s) each student will be asked to share or post one question or one word that represents the student&rsquo;s observation on stickies and post in the classroom &ldquo;parking lot.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Next, students will find pictures or references to those events in their Social Studies books or the school district&rsquo;s curriculum. Discuss the results of their search.
<ul>
<li>Extended Learning Option: You can also choose to have students research the information on the internet and create data charts of the information/validity and number of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; they have</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask students to share their feelings about the events the discuss and locate information the information in their textbooks</li>
<li>Students will compare / contrast information from the videos to their classroom textbooks/resources</li>
<li>Students will identify the impact of their research (videos vs. textbooks /district&rsquo;s Social Studies curriculum)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity two</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reflection with Evidence Assignment - Students will respond to the following question:&nbsp; <em>How do the marginalization or elimination of this information/event from your resources (history books, curriculum, etc.) depict various groups of people in our society?&nbsp; </em></li>
<li>Students&rsquo; choice to present the answer to the question
<ul>
<li>Written
<ul>
<li>Editorial</li>
<li>Argumentative Essay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oral</li>
<li>Artistic Representation of any medium</li>
<li>Digital creation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Students will discuss or present their answers possible solutions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson: Anti-Racist Curriculum-Disrupting the Dominant Narrative</h3>
<p>Students will make predictions about a little-known event/time in history that was not included in their Social Studies books textbooks and or curriculum.&nbsp; Students will discuss their observations and feeling about the event as well as its elimination from student resources.&nbsp; Students will develop their own definition and understanding of anti-racist curriculum.&nbsp; Lastly, students will develop activities and possible solutions to counter the effects of the dominant narrative or racist curriculum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction - Definition scramble &ndash; Using the definitions of anti-racist curriculum / social justice/ racism - Students must organize their word cards in the correct definition without talking.</li>
<li>Students can work with schools across the district to form an awareness group</li>
<li>Students will create their own definition of anti-racist curriculum</li>
<li>Students at schools across the district can meet over Zoom to discuss the process of developing anti-racist activities, a district academic showcase for activities or projects that best exemplify anti-racist strategies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson: Table Talk Series</h3>
<p>This series can start in the classroom or be used at a district-wide event, involving schools inside or outside of the district.&nbsp; Students can broadcast the discussions over Zoom or Google Classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Students can serve as the moderators</li>
<li>Teacher is the guide/coordinator</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Questions to consider for the table talk series</em>.&nbsp; (The table talk process will take several class periods):</p>
<p>Who/ what group of people made the decisions that led to the events mentioned in the video?</p>
<p>What group of people were in power during the time of the historical events that were viewed on the videos?&nbsp; What group of people have influence today?</p>
<p>Who more than likely made decisions about eliminating the information from the books?</p>
<p>Why do you think this information was kept secret or people were told not to mention the massacre?</p>
<p>How can actions like erasing or not mentioning important historical events like this impact society?</p>
<p>How does this dominant narrative erasure (from Social Studies textbooks, curricula, and resources) impact learning for students?</p>
<p>Have students discuss what they feel the meaning of the term anti-racist curriculum means?&nbsp; Next, the teacher reveals/shares several definitions of anti-racist curriculum.</p>
<p>How can you as students use your voice to create change or counter the impact of things like this?</p>
<p><em>Suggested questions including the following questions from the Connecticut Social Studies Frameworks:</em></p>

<li>How do Americans define freedom and equality and how have American conceptions of freedom and equality changed over the course of U.S. history for members of various racial, ethnic, religious, and gender minority groups?</li>
<li>Is America a land of political, economic, and social opportunity?</li>
<li>What was the significance of Connecticut&rsquo;s contribution to America&rsquo;s story?</li>

<h3>NCSS &ndash; The 10 Themes of Social Studies</h3>
<ol>
<li>Culture.
<ul>
<li>Human beings create, learn, share, and adapt to culture.</li>
<li>Cultures are dynamic and change over time.</li>
<li>Through experience, observation, and reflection, students will identify elements of culture as well as similarities and differences among cultural groups across time and place.</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology, and anthropology, as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time, Continuity, and Change
<ul>
<li>Studying the past makes it possible for us to understand the human story across time.</li>
<li>Knowledge and understanding of the past enable us to analyze the causes and consequences of events and developments, and to place these in the context of the institutions, values and beliefs of the periods in which they took place.</li>
<li>Knowing how to read, reconstruct and interpret the past allows us to answer questions</li>
<li>Through a more formal study of history, students in the middle grades continue to expand their understanding of the past and are increasingly able to apply the research methods associated with historical inquiry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People, Places, and Environments
<ul>
<li>The study of people, places, and environments enables us to understand the relationship between human populations and the physical world.</li>
<li>During their studies, learners develop an understanding of spatial perspectives, and examine changes in the relationship between peoples, places and environments.</li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s social, cultural, economic and civic issues demand that students apply knowledge, skills, and understandings as they address questions</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, regional studies, and world cultures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual Development and Identity
<ul>
<li>Personal identity is shaped by an individual&rsquo;s culture, by groups, by institutional influences, and by lived experiences shared with people inside and outside the individual&rsquo;s own culture throughout her or his development.</li>
<li>The study of individual development and identity will help students to describe factors important to the development of personal identity.</li>
<li>In the early grades, young learners develop their personal identities in the context of families, peers, schools, and communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individuals, Groups, and Institutions
<ul>
<li>Institutions are the formal and informal political, economic, and social organizations that help us carry out, organize, and manage our daily affairs.</li>
<li>It is important that students know how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they control and influence individuals and culture, and how institutions can be maintained or changed.</li>
<li>Students identify those institutions that they encounter.</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, and history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power, Authority, and Governance
<ul>
<li>The development of civic competence requires an understanding of the foundations of political thought, and the historical development of various structures of power, authority, and governance. It also requires knowledge of the evolving functions of these structures in contemporary U.S. society, as well as in other parts of the world.</li>
<li>In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as:
<ul>
<li>What are the purposes and functions of government?</li>
<li>Under what circumstances is the exercise of political power legitimate?</li>
<li>What are the proper scope and limits of authority?</li>
<li>How are individual rights protected and challenged within the context of majority rule?</li>
<li>What conflicts exist among fundamental principles and values of constitutional democracy?</li>
<li>What are the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a constitutional democracy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Through study of the dynamic relationships between individual rights and responsibilities, the needs of social groups, and concepts of a just society, learners become more effective problem-solvers and decision-makers when addressing the persistent issues and social problems encountered in public life.</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with government, politics, political science, civics, history, law, and other social sciences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Production, Distribution, and Consumption
<ul>
<li>In exploring this theme, students confront such questions as:
<ul>
<li>How does interdependence brought on by globalization, impact local economies and social systems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with concepts, principles, and issues drawn from the discipline of economics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Science, Technology, and Society
<ul>
<li>Science, and its practical application, technology, have had a major influence on social and cultural change, and on the ways people interact with the world.</li>
<li>There are many questions about the role that science and technology play in our lives and in our cultures</li>
<li>This theme appears in units or courses dealing with history, geography, economics, and civics and government.</li>
<li>Analyses of the costs and benefits of increased global connections, and evaluations of the tensions between national interests and global priorities, contribute to the development of possible solutions to persistent and emerging global issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Global Connections
<ul>
<li>Global connections have intensified and accelerated the changes faced at the local, national, and international levels.</li>
<li>In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as:
<ul>
<li>What are the different types of global connections?</li>
<li>What global connections have existed in the past, exist currently, and are likely in the future?</li>
<li>How do ideas spread between societies in today&rsquo;s interconnected world? How does this result in change in those societies?</li>
<li>What are the other consequences of global connections? What are the benefits and problems associated with global interdependence?</li>
<li>How might people in different parts of the world have different perspectives on these benefits and problems?</li>
<li>How should people and societies balance global connectedness with local needs?</li>
<li>What is needed for life to thrive on an ever changing and increasingly interdependent planet?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture, economics, history, political science, government, and technology but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities, including literature, the arts, and languages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civic Ideals and Practices
<ul>
<li>An understanding of civic ideals and practices is critical to full participation in society and is an essential component of education for citizenship, which is the central purpose of social studies.</li>
<li>Learning how to apply civic ideals as part of citizen action is essential to the exercise of democratic freedoms and the pursuit of the common good.</li>
<li>In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with civics, history, political science, cultural anthropology, and fields such as global studies and law-related education, while also drawing upon content from the humanities.</li>
</ul>
