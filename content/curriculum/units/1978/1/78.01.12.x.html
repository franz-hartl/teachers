<A NAME="a">
Realizing that the average eighth-grade student seldom has an opportunity to write, I have fashioned a curriculum which will provide writing practice. Dr. Johnson, the l8th-century literary figure, writes that “of all skills, part is infused by precept, and part is obtained by habit.” Further I assume that the student entering my classroom in September has had no previous knowledge of grammatical terms (precepts) and their use. While I am looking for content and creativity, the major objective of this program is to reduce errors in writing. Thus, more than half the program deals with grammar, the great bugaboo and bane of the English teacher, and how the student can use his knowledge of these writing tools to reduce errors in composition. The other portion of the program provides structured writing assignments twice a week.<P>

Getting the student to recognize and write a complete sentence takes time, but must be accomplished before any actual writing can take place or be evaluated. While students may write in longer syntactic units without this fundamental step, they are prone to make unnecessary errors because they have not codified their knowledge. They have no way to check their writing unless they know grammatical terms.<P>

I begin with the simple sentence, subject, and predicate. The student will be able to identify these two parts of a sentence with 95% accuracy. The students will recognize and complete a sentence fragment, making it a sentence. They will also avoid this devastating error in their writing.<P>

In the unit of the complete sentence, the student also will learn to recognize and avoid the run-on sentence. The student practices reducing run-on sentences to short complete simple sentences, deleting or supplying parts as necessary. The goal of this part of the unit is, of course, to reduce this error in the student’s written expression.<P>

Teaching the student when to capitalize is also part of this unit, as is the correct use of the comma in the simple sentence. Capitalizing will be taught first and the students will master this element before proceeding to the comma and its use. Reducing errors in student writing is, again, the goal of this section.<P>

The second unit stresses the use of verbs in sentence building. By the eighth grade, most students can identify “action” or “doing” verbs and use them in simple sentences; however, a quick review of both the term and its application can serve as an introduction to the much more difficult concept of the “state-of-being” verb.<P>

The auxiliary verb may be introduced concurrently with the lessons on “state-of-being” verbs. Following this unit, the verb form should be learned. The student should become aware of telling time with verbs, and drills and writing assignments should be designed to have students illustrate a knowledge of regular and irregular verb forms. A good assignment would give a student a list of verbs to use in a writing assignment and give the students a particular time reference; for example, “all of this happened the day before yesterday and will never happen again. Remember, you are telling us about it today.”<P>

Unit III focuses on the noun. I prefer to teach this after the verb because the students grasp the function of nouns in simple sentences when they can see the relation of the noun to the verb, the center of a sentence. The students master the noun as subject first, the noun as direct object second. This is a fine opportunity to review the action verb. The student then will learn the predicate nominative.<P>

The students enjoy the noun in direct address. At this point they are ready to use the appositive. The teacher must pay studious attention to the placement of both commas when the appositive occurs in the middle of the sentence; the students usually remember the first one and forget the second.<P>

The final step of Unit III is to teach students to distinguish the active and passive voice. For me, this is an optional step. I have not had a student in the eighth grade use the passive voice to the extent that it presents a problem. However, if the teacher sees a need, now is the time to teach the difference. The teacher should also be certain to remind students who have this chronic weakness to correct it in several ensuing assignments so that the students will be made conscious of the differing voices before writing.<P>

All students will make errors in subject-verb agreement from time to time because they write using the “it sounds right” theory of language. Although it may indeed sound right, it has no place in written expression. Unit lV should contain constant drill and provide the students with writing assignments which include subjects and verbs of different number. This will help the student codify his knowledge. The students should read examples aloud. By hearing the standard form more often, they will begin to associate it with their “it sounds right” theory. Do not ever discreetly hesitate to correct a student’s speech. You can do this without “slapping” a child in the face with his language.<P>

Having mastered the above skills, the student now progresses into an area which, to my students, has proven to be confusing—the pronoun. Perhaps I have moved too quickly, expecting too much, too soon. Now I move slowly from personal pronouns to interrogative to indefinite to demonstrative pronouns. Once the children know the terms and can give examples of each in a simple sentence, they should learn the following uses: the pronoun as a compound part, how to avoid the apostrophe in possessive pronouns, agreement of pronoun subjects and their verbs, and the agreement of pronouns and their antecedents.<P>

Unit VI deals with the adjective. Students manage to learn adjectives quickly, but once learned, they are overused. Don’t worry, let them enjoy adjectives; language is fun. You will have to spend more time explaining predicate adjectives because this requires reviewing state-of-being verbs; but the students, given some review, experience little trouble recognizing or using predicate adjectives in their writing. Students may confuse predicate adjectives in their writing. Students may confuse predicate adjectives and predicate nominatives. Review is the only cure.<P>

Adjectival words or words that do not normally function as adjectives should be taught next. For example, in the sentence, “1 have two African cousins,” ”African” comes from a proper noun. To appreciate the flexibility of English, the child should be exposed to words which function as several parts of speech. One possible assignment is to have the students generate as many of these words as possible and use them in a descriptive context.<P>

The student is now ready to explore using phrases as adjectives. I do not mention prepositions at this time because the students has enough variables to consider. Here, again, try to instill an appreciation for the language, rather than a fear of it. Students can identify a group of words modifying a noun and can generate groups of words as adjectives without being conscious that a prepositional phrase ever existed, or will exist in English.<P>

Your students will be able to grasp the concept of a one-word adverb with relative ease. When they are provided with opportunities to write using this concept, they will probably have a problem with only one area, and that is an adverb modifying another adverb. Old-fashioned drill must play a major part in the student’s learning to increase recognition and to reduce errors.<P>

Students will learn the forms of an adverb and how to distinguish them from adjectives to avoid the usual confusion between the two. Students must be taught standard adverb usage and how to use adverbs that compare properly if they are to reduce errors in their writing.<P>

The adverb phrase should also be introduced here with the same restraint as was used with the adjectival phrase. I also teach the indirect object here as a precursor of the prepositional phrase. Diagramming with the (<I>X</I>)to represent the missing word will help your students to understand what an indirect object is and how it functions.<P>

Unit VIII focuses on the prepositional phrase, and regardless of current pedagogical thought, I insist that my students memorize the standard list of prepositions. Once they have learned the prepositions they can learn the structure of the prepositional phrase. This is a good chance to review adjectival and adverbial phrases and nouns as objects.<P>

You might want the students to go over one of their favorite papers in a scavenger hunt for prepositional phrases. Make a game of it; provide some simple prizes for the student who can find the most. I find it helpful to use sentence diagrams when teaching grammar because they show students the relationship among parts of a sentence. Students find diagramming prepositional phrases especially helpful—and a lot of fun.<P>

Up to this point the student has been dashing off short pieces of writing using only simple sentences, and has mastered all of the above elements (see Appendix A for writing assignments). Keep him writing for two or three more weeks with the same constraints; let him flex and develop a writing muscle. Edward Corbett writes in <I>Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student</I> that precepts and imitation can <I>teach</I> the student how to write, but it is only by writing that the student will <I>learn</I> how to write. “One learns to write by writing.”<SUP>1</SUP> Keep rewarding students’ output. At the end of the second week, devise a writing assignment for each student that will provide specific practice in an area which troubles the child. Show the child the area before he commences the assignment. You are trying to make him supremely aware of his mistakes and the modes of correction. You can build his confidence in his writing ability by showing him how to correct his errors. Everyone strives for perfection.<P>

Once the children are writing simple sentences with 95% accuracy, lead them to compound sentences. The coordinate conjunctions must be learned, and comma placement. (Have them place the commas regardless of the sentence length. It is less of an error to have one than to omit one, and the distinction may be confusing to some students at this age.) Now student writing should reflect a combination of simple and compound sentences. Provide test cases where they have to write five simple and ten compound sentences on a topic. Change the proportions, but keep them writing and looking at their writing. Have the students read each other’s work to verify both the count and the accuracy of the sentence types.<P>

For the student to grasp and keep the concept of a complex sentence, the teacher must proceed slowly, explaining first the independent clause. Review this concept as it applies to both the simple and compound sentence. The student should then learn the dependent clause as adjectival and adverbial. I find it much easier if I have the students memorize the standard subordinating conjunctions.<P>

I cannot emphasize enough the importance of practice in these units. You must provide exercises that first concentrate on having the student recognize the items; then, on having the student generate his own examples; and finally, on having the student put the principle into practice in his writing. Insist upon memorization; despite popular rumor, English does follow set patterns which can be learned. Much of the current research implies that teaching grammar is a waste of time. I would suggest that traditional grammar has failed because teachers refuse to present it as a sequence, building one idea upon another. They ignore the patterns, but instead teach bits and pieces. H.A. Gleason notes:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>The consequences of a movement to teach less and less grammar are inescapable. Language is a system (or a complex of systems). Its grammar must be systematic to be meaningful. Bits and pieces cannot be taught or omitted at will simply because they are individually judged useful or not. No one would seriously propose omitting from the arithmetic curriculum in the primary grades the teaching of 2 x 2 = 4 on the ground that high school students made fewer errors with this than with 9 x 7 = 63. If the multiplication table is to be taught, it is far better and easier to teach the whole and to teach it systematically. It, like English, is a system.<SUP>2</SUP><P>

</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>Always keep in mind that errors cannot be eliminated without joint diligence, yours and the student’s. We must, as teachers, try to instill in students, or rather, draw out of students, a healthy respect for a language which will not betray them if they follow the rules.<P>

The students are actually writing paragraphs, short stories, and poems; but now they must be given a form they can react within. You have not mentioned paragraphs yet in a formal lesson. Now is the time. In the future, I plan to use a combination of the traditional topic sentence-supporting details and an approach developed by a colleague, Paul Limone. Once the students start generating paragraphs, show them several transitional methods that link the paragraphs into a sustained piece of error-free prose. Let them practice, each student writing and gaining strength all the while. Writing is no different from other skills; it can be learned and it takes time.<P>

This program is designed to last a year. The teacher must decide how long to spend on each unit. Don’t rush your students and don’t skip around. English is a multi-faceted discipline that affords students exposure to many different areas. In the middle school, one should attempt to open all the horizons for the child. Teaching these writing tools to the exclusion of literature, non-fiction, and drama will do a great disservice to your students. You will be able to integrate the grammar and writing assignments with any other area if you give some thought to your assignments. Whether your students are writing a short story or an essay about a novel, keep them within the constraints they have learned. Insist upon error-free prose; hold the students accountable for anything they have learned. Expect the very best—you’ll get it.<P>

<P><I>What To Remember About Predicate Nominatives</I><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>1. (Definition) A noun that follows the verb and renames, or means the same thing as, the subject is a predicate nominative, or a predicate noun. Example: John Scott is an honest <I>man</I>. (The word <I>man</I> renames <I>John Scott</I>, the subject.)

<DT>2. To decide whether a noun is used as a predicate nominative, replace the verb with equals (-). If the sentence then makes the same sense as before, you have a predicate nominative.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>My dog is a collie. (dog-collie)

<DT>3. Predicate nominatives, like subjects, may be compound.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>My father is a <I>plumber</I>, a <I>bowler</I>, and a White Sox <I>fan</I>.

<DT>4. (Definition) A verb completed by a predicate nominative is a linking verb. It links the subject and the predicate nominative. The main linking verbs are these: <I>is</I>, <I>am, are</I>, <I>was</I>, <I>were</I>, <I>be</I>, <I>being</I>, <I>been</I>, and the forms of <I>become</I>, <I>seem</I> and <I>appear</I>.

<TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><TD>Earl <I>has become</I> a Scout.   <TD>Pam <I>seems</I> a friendly girl.

</TABLE><DT>5. (Definition) A sentence containing a predicate nominative is a <I>Pattern 2</I> sentence. Here is the formula: N / LV / N. (LV is the symbol for linking verb.)

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>N / LV / N

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>The first boy is Jack.

</DL></BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>What To Remember About Compound Sentences</I><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>1. (Definition) A compound sentence joins two or more independent clauses. (Definition) An independent clause (a) contains a verb and its subject, and (b) can stand alone as a sentence.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>(The whistle blew shrilly), and (the game began).

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>(I rang the bell), and (Ed pounded on the door), but (no one came).

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Note that each clause could stand alone as a simple sentence.

<DT>2. Only clauses closely related in thought should be joined.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Good: Tom sent to the game, but Fred could not go.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Poor: Tom went to the game, and I like him.

<DT>3. A compound sentence divides into independent clauses.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Mother was canning peaches,/and/I helped her.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>A simple sentence with a compound subject or verb cannot divide and have each part make sense by itself.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>The car sped down the hill and / turned the corner.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>(Turned the corner has no subject.)

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>My oldest brother / or / my father will meet you.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>(My oldest brother is not a clause by itself because it has no verb.)

<DT>4. The conjunctions used most often in compound sentences are the co-ordinate conjunctions <I>and</I>, <I>but</I>, <I>or</I>, <I>nor</I>.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>(Definition) <I>Co-ordinate conjunctions</I> join words, phrases, or clauses of equal value.

<DT>5. A co-ordinate conjunction merely joins; it is not in any clause.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Henry has a baseball,/<I>and</I>/ Robert has a bat.

<DT>6. Independent clauses are separated by a comma.

<DT><FONT COLOR=#ffffff>____</FONT>Henry has a baseball, and Robert has a bat.
