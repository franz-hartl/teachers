<H3>Background Information</H3>

The intent of this eight-week unit is to point out the struggle of women writers to become recognized and included in the literature of this century.<P>

Throughout American history, women have suffered, often without hope of improving their situation. Today they are demanding an end to discrimination. They have organized to gain equal treatment in order that their rights no longer be denied. Laws and practices have changed and women are demanding equal treatment with men.<P>

The early writings of American women began in the late 1700’s and the early 1800’s with magazine articles containing the latest information on fashions, popular science, household hints, and other domestic matters. According to the contributors to these magazines, piety, purity, and domesticity were the foundations on which to build feminine happiness. By teaching every woman proper standards of behavior, dress, and literary tastes, mass circulation magazines fostered the aspirations of lower-class women who wanted to become ladies just like middle-class women. These periodicals required many writers and naturally women were the ones who could provide the proper tone and approach. Many women writers began to come into their own with the advent of ladies’ magazines.<P>

Contributions to these magazines were at first submitted anonymously because society did not approve of women writers or women who worked outside of the home. By the 1830’s it was possible for a lady to admit to authorship. Sarah Hale, best known for her “Mary Had A Little Lamb,” had a great influence through her forty years as editor of <I>Godey’s Lady’s Book</I>, the most important magazine of its type, with a circulation of 150,000. Mrs. Hale used her columns to advocate higher education for women and to advise them to train as doctors and nurses, occupations she considered perfectly compatible with “true womanhood.” She published a total of thirty-six volumes during her lifetime and inspired other women to go into journalism.<P>

Women who took up professional literary pursuits had talent, drive, and economic need just as men did. Most of these women came from families that were able to provide them with a good education. Some were single or widowed and many had dependents to support. Their career choices were limited. Except for teaching, writing was the only professional career widely available to women in the nineteenth century.<P>

Some of these pioneer writers were Lydia Marie Child (18021880), a novelist; Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888), author of <I>Little Women </I>and other novels; and Jane Swisshelm (1815-1884), owner and editor of <I>The St. Cloud Visitor </I>in Minnesota. One of the most famous of anti-slavery writers was Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of <I>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</I>.<P>

In the early years of the twentieth century women were an important part of reform activity which occurred as a result of problems created by industrialization and territorial expansion. Twentieth century women were impatient with the lack of progress of reform to improve the status of women. The woman’s rights movement, for a short while, united women of all social classes in a common cause. During World War I women entered new fields of industry and many people were of the opinion that the long struggle for women’s suffrage would be ended. The struggle for suffrage did end when women gained the right to vote in 1920, but the vote turned out to be relatively unimportant in improving women’s status.<P>

The Depression had an adverse effect on whatever economic gains women had made because men were given priority for scarce jobs. World War II changed this trend, and once again women were employed in large numbers in industry. But at the end of the war men again replaced women in industrial jobs. Most women returned to their jobs as homemakers and mothers.<P>

In the 1950’s there was a dramatic rise in the birth rate, accompanied by earlier marriages and a general acceptance of the old-fashioned view that “woman’s place is in the home.” However, women’s share of the labor market increased at the same time.<P>

The new feminism in the 1960’s was a movement composed primarily of middle-class women who wished to revive the struggle of women to achieve equal rights. The struggles of women of previous generations had improved the status of women, although social values, mores, and institutions lagged far behind the material and economic progress that had been made.<P>

In literature some well-known authors were Mary Roberts Rinehart, Edna Ferber, Pearl Buck, Frances Parkinson Keyes, Dorothy Parker, Katherine Ann Porter, and journalist Dorothy Thompson. With less social restraints in the twentieth century, women are now writing plays, television scripts, and newspaper columns. Woman is no longer limited by her ability to take advantage of the many choices open to her. She is no longer faced with the conflict between career and motherhood; she can choose both.<P>

<H3>Course Objectives</H3>

This will be an eight-week unit on women writers. One objective is to make students aware of how women became involved as writers in the twentieth century, and also to point out the success of women in the field of literature. However, the main objective is to continue to improve the reading skills of students and to help them read for enjoyment and gain information about some of the main literary types. The major focus is on the concept of narrative form. Students should have a thorough understanding of plot, climax, conflict, and the use of details and causal connections in building narrative. They are given the opportunity to discern and enjoy variety in plot development.<P>

As students relate to their own experiences the thoughts and feelings of characters in fiction, they will be able to evaluate the truth or falsity of the author’s presentation. A deepening awareness of the interpretation of character and of personal reactions comes as students evaluate characters according to what they say and how they say it, what they do, and what others in the story say about them.<P>

If students are to have adequate awareness of a writer’s accomplishments, if they are to respect a work and see reasons for its inclusion in a course of study or on a reading list, they should be helped to see the full formal nature of the literary achievement. The teacher should show the problems raised by the writing of a particular work and the strategies applied by the author.<P>

The first decision facing anyone who teaches a literary work is the amount of time to spend on it. Teachers usually spend more time than necessary on a full-length piece of fiction. It then becomes boring to the students. With fiction the question, “What are we doing this for?” must be repeatedly asked, and the answers must direct the nature of class activities, the length of assignments, the kinds of testing, and the extent to which supplementary activities (writing, word study, further reading on a similar theme) will be used. The class discussion itself can be a means of clarifying details in the story. The teacher should constantly associate the material with what students already know— with other stories, motion pictures, television programs, plays.<P>

Throughout the discussion, reference should be made to the text. Students should not be permitted to make assertions about idea, theme, or character unless they can support what they say with specific passages in the book. Furthermore, close attention to the text makes possible a constant analysis of its language.<P>

<H3>To Kill a Mockingbird</H3>

<H4>Lesson Plan #1</H4>

The author, Miss Harper Lee, was born on April 28, 1926, in Monroeville, Alabama. She attended the local public schools, then Huntington College. Later she studied law at the University of Alabama but never completed work for the law degree. Her study of the law may be reflected in the simplicity of her style. Every event is narrated with a straightforward, simple approach. In her first novel, <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I>, a lawyer is the main character. For this work she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the best novel of 1960. The book has been made into a successful movie.<P>
