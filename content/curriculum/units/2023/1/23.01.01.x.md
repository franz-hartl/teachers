	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I teach in a self-contained classroom at Edgewood Magnet School in New Haven. I find the neighborhood/magnet setting a rewarding environment, with students coming to school each day from a variety of home circumstances and with differences in academic levels. As a result of these variables, the children have differing levels of background knowledge and life experiences. The classroom is a mixture of varied ethnicities, economic strata, and social and emotional strengths and weaknesses. The use of collaboration allows all students at all levels to learn in an inherently differentiated environment, learning new concepts and experiences through hands-on practices. Throughout the school year, the kindergarten curriculum centers heavily on social development, which is certainly appropriate for five- and six-year-old children. Our school mission and vision statements focus on equity and inclusion, acknowledging and including everyone in our learning environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the kindergarten school year, we use poetry quite a bit in various ways. It is woven throughout the literacy curriculum as we introduce conceptual and content learning and work to develop reading and writing skills. Starting, of course, with reading poems out loud, we use sing-a-longs and chants to get the students involved. Poems help students identify rhyming words, reinforce phonics and phonemic awareness, promote language development, and improve memory and focus. Along with these benefits, poetry also provides a medium for students to express their feelings and develop social skills by working on and learning poems together. Children improve their ability to focus while memorizing a poem and build an appreciation for the beauty of language and how it can create rhythm and rhyme. As stepping stones, poems can help students develop creative speech and expression for young children as they develop and grow into adulthood.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The unit will address several Common Core State Standards for Literacy, including craft and structure, knowledge and ideas, phonics and phonological awareness, comprehension and collaboration, and production of writing.</p>
<p>April is Poetry Month and a fun time for students as we listen to and learn a new poem almost daily. Although we hear poems throughout the year, this is a time of more intensive focus and gives us an opportunity to highlight and compare many different styles, authors, subjects, and purposes. The month-long celebration of poetry will include Poem in Your Pocket Day, an initiative led by the Academy of American Poets to encourage participation in poetry. Students carry the poem, &ldquo;Keep a Poem in Your Pocket,&rdquo; by Beatrice Schenk De Regniers, for the entire final day. This strategy of carrying a poem for the day is a central approach for the month. Students will make and wear their &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; each day for the month with a new poem each day, a collection of many different styles from a variety of poets.</p>
<p>This unit will start with some introductory questions for the students: What is a poem? Does the title matter? What do poems sound like? Can we remember and recite poems that we learned? Where can we find poems? What feelings do poems make us feel? Can we be poets?</p>
<p>Young students have shared what they already know about poems and poetry. This list changes a bit from year to year, but these are the essential comments from kindergarteners and certainly provide a framework for starting out.</p>
<p>Poems have words.</p>
<p>Poems rhyme.</p>
<p>Poems have more than one word.</p>
<p>It is not a book, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a cover.</p>
<p>We can write poems</p>
<p>We can sing poems</p>
<p>Poems can have pictures or not have pictures.</p>
<p>Poems have to make sense.</p>
<p>Poems can be funny.</p>
<p>Fairy tales and nursery rhymes are poems.</p>
<p>Poems can be long or short.</p>
<p>There are lots of poems in the world.</p>
<p>Poems can be fiction or nonfiction.</p>
<p>The unit is designed to help students recognize that poems have stories, moods, actions, and descriptions and can be partnered with art. We will develop a visual poetry toolbox that students could refer to when working on their own poems - repetition, alliteration, music, imagination, and onomatopoeia. Some ideas for introducing poetry as sound and object are a couple of poems for the starting days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jump or Jiggle</em> by Evelyn Beyer</p>
<p><em>I'm Glad I'm Me</em> by Jack Perlutsky</p>
<p><em>Crayons: A Rainbow Poem</em> by Jane Yolen</p>
<p><em>Firefly</em> by Elizabeth Madox Roberts</p>
<p><em>Now We Are Six</em> by A.A. Milne</p>
<p><em>Caterpillar</em> by Christina Rossetti</p>
<p><em>Aim High to the Sky</em> by James McDonald</p>
<p><em>Mary&rsquo;s Lamb</em> by Sarah Josepha Hale</p>
<p><em>Poor Old Lady</em> by Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Power of Poetry</h2>
<p>Poetry helps with spelling. Students with a good awareness of rhyme and rhyming skills tend to become better readers and spellers. Focusing on rhyme helps them look at patterns within words and how they are formed, supporting word recognition and spelling.</p>
<p>Speech development improves. Playing with sounds and rhyming patterns in words supports the development of the mouth, pharynx, and nose, helping speech and language development. Poetry also paves the way for the articulation of phonemes as children start to understand phonics.</p>
<p>Reading becomes more fluent. The tunes and patterns of poems support children in developing reading fluency, meaning poetry is a powerful genre for engaging more reluctant readers, and for encouraging more confident readers to pay closer attention to the words, improving reading comprehension skills.</p>
<p>It allows children to develop their own opinions. A poem is not a puzzle to be solved: there is no right or wrong answer when children are talking about poems or sharing opinions about what they are listening to or reading, which can give them confidence in expressing their views to others in the class. The physical space between lines and stanzas also provides a pause for children to reflect and make their own interpretations.</p>
<p>It inspires creativity. Poems can help inspire children to become writers themselves. They often gain a sense of voice and think carefully about their subject matter, language, grammar, and style through writing poetry of their own. Writing poems encourages them to reflect on their experiences and describe them using their own voice. They can also experiment with different writing devices like alliteration and onomatopoeia, making their writing more dynamic and exciting.</p>
<p>It helps develop interpretation skills. Poetry extends children&rsquo;s interpretive skills and ability to infer and deduce beyond the literal words. One of the strengths of poetry is its brevity: in a short piece of writing, children can think about the author&rsquo;s intent, understanding why choices might have been made and the effects these have. This is certainly a high-level skill for a reader and a writer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It encourages a wide vocabulary and varied grammar. Poetry plays with language, and poets make deliberate choices in the way they use words and punctuation for the ultimate effect on the reader. Reading poetry allows children to look at ways to compose ideas in a variety of ways and choose the language that would best convey meaning.</p>
<p>It helps children understand their emotions. Poetry supports the development of children&rsquo;s emotional literacy. They can learn to manage and reflect on their emotions, feelings, and behavior by drawing on experiences they hear about in poems shared. When they write their own poetry, they can give form and significance to a particular event or feeling that was important to them and communicate it to the reader or to the listener.</p>
<p>It introduces different writers, subjects, and styles. By providing a selection of different poems by various writers for young students to explore, including videos of poets performing their work, children learn to respond to language and themes, poetic forms, and devices along with encouraging children to become writers of poetry themselves.</p>
<p>It transports them to new worlds. With the world connecting, changing, and developing at a very fast rate, and where local, national, and global events can have an impact on children&rsquo;s lives, poetry can help students navigate and make sense of experiences, as well as provide some entertainment and escapism, through witty rhymes that make them giggle or mythical poems that transport them to a different space and time.</p>
<p>Throughout the month, the students will hear poets reading their own poetry (particularly young authors and poets), providing the awareness and connection that they can also write and read their own poems. A celebrating component will end the month when we invite families to our poetry party.</p>
<h2>Teaching Strategies</h2>
<p>The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world concerns capture students&rsquo; interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Project-based learning helps prepare students for thinking and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Organized around open-ended questioning, project-based learning helps focus the students&rsquo; work and deepen their learning by centering on significant issues or problems. Projects begin by presenting students with knowledge and concepts and then, once learned, allowing them to apply them. It requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new - an idea, an interpretation, or a new way of displaying what they have learned.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. Students across grade levels and content area learning need to do much more than remember information&mdash;they need to use higher-order thinking skills. They also must learn to work as a team and contribute to a group effort. They must listen to others and make their ideas clear when speaking, be able to read a variety of material, write or otherwise express themselves in various modes, and make effective presentations. The format of this approach allows for student voice and choice. Students learn to work independently and take responsibility when they are asked to make choices. The opportunity to make choices, and to express their learning in their own voice, also helps to increase students&rsquo; educational engagement.</p>
<p>Within the activities in this unit, literacy strategies partnered with social-emotional learning skills will help students understand what they see and feel. They will identify how language, structure, and facial expressions contribute to meaning; draw inferences about feelings, thoughts, and motives from their actions and image; and justify inferences with evidence. Reading strategies will include craft and structure, knowledge and ideas, phonics and phonological awareness, comprehension and collaboration, and production of writing.</p>
<h2>Classroom Activities</h2>
<p>The broad objective of this unit is for students to learn about poetry and develop some skills to use as we learn to listen to and enjoy a variety of poems together.&nbsp; Students learn to think about and communicate their importance in their understanding of the power of poetry. They will hear poems from many authors from diverse backgrounds and across time.&nbsp; Each time the students hear a poem, they can tuck a copy in their pockets and carry it around for the day.</p>
<h3>Session One: Poem in a Pocket</h3>
<p>Materials: a variety of pockets; lanyard material such as yarn, ribbon, and boondoggle of various colors; small rhinestones; stickers; buttons; fabric markers; permanent markers, such as Sharpies; glue; copies of the poem, printed and cut to fit in the pockets, approximately 3&rdquo;x 5&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To prepare for the unit, gather several clothing items with pockets, particularly a pants back pocket or a shirt front pocket. Cut the pockets apart from the clothing, leaving an inch or so around the perimeter of the stitching that holds the pocket to the background. Also, cut rectangles of card stock to match the size and shape of the pockets, to be used as support backing for the pockets. Once they are separated from the garment, they will lose some structural integrity and the card stock, attached to the back, will keep the pocket flat and supported. Attach the card stock and then punch two holes at the top of the pocket, one on the left, the other on the right, making the pocket into a necklace. The holes should go through all the layers. Students will select a lanyard to string through the holes, tie to secure, and place over their heads to adjust the sizing. They now have a pocket for their poetry collection.</p>
<p>With a variety of materials, students can customize their pockets, adding their names, decorating, and personalizing. While these are drying and setting up, it is time to introduce how their pockets will be used during the month.</p>
<p>The first poem to hear, learn, and then slip into their pocket &ndash; <em>Keep a Poem in Your Pocket </em>by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers.</p>
<p>Students should wear their lanyards during class time only and pockets should remain at school until the end of the unit.</p>
<h3>Session Two: Poetry Toolbox</h3>
<p>Materials: printed images (laminated), pocket chart, bulletin board area as alternate</p>
<p><img src="/curriculum/images/2023/23.01.01.01.png" alt="elements of a poetry toolbox"/></p>
<p>Figure 1: Elements of a Poetry Toolbox</p>
<p>A visual aid to use with the students is a Poetry Toolbox. Each image is printed individually and tucked behind the picture of the toolbox. The toolbox can be positioned at the top of a pocket chart or tacked up on a bulletin board.&nbsp; Once the students discover a new tool, take it out of the toolbox and display it in the classroom. This not only helps them know what to can look for in a poem, but they can later use these tools when they are writing their own poems. The toolbox has laminated visual reminders of each tool we discover. A new tool will not be introduced each day, so often repeats and reminders of familiar tools can be helpful for each new poem. Images include love and friendship, colors, music, imagination, repeated words and repetition, onomatopoeia, alliteration, simile, and the senses.</p>
<h3>Session Three and Beyond: Daily Poems for the Month</h3>
<p>Materials: selected poems, typed and prepared for pockets; folders or booklets for storing daily poems.</p>
<p>Below is a list of poems to use daily. The list contains many more poems than days in the month, by design. This offers options for what would best work at the time, allows for student choice, and provides an opportunity to extend the experience beyond the unit. Poems should be prepared in a size that fits into the poem pockets, roughly 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As students begin to collect their many poems, a folder or small notebook would provide a place to store the poems at the end of each day. Poems can be used in additional ways beyond listening and sharing together. Highlighting rhyming words, locating beginning sounds, finding color words, acting out the story, and making pictures to demonstrate understanding are all examples of how to extend the learning in small groups.</p>
<p>The daily poem should be posted in the classroom, either written out on chart paper or displayed on a smart board so that students can enjoy it throughout the day. The power of poetry strategies and skills can be incorporated into discussions and likely prompt additional questions. At the end of the day, post a printed copy of the poem on a bulletin board that is dedicated to the collection. By the end of the month, the entire collection will be on display.</p>
