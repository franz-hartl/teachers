                The Annual Reports describe the Institute's operation in New

                and seminar leaders at the conclusion of their participation.
                They also contain material on program evaluation, national
                dissemination, and financial and program development. The

                Yale and attended by 27 teams of teachers and administrators
                from educational partnerships across the United States. The

                The Institute's national initiative aims to demonstrate that the
                approach the Institute has taken for more than two decades in
                New Haven can be tailored to establish similar partnerships
                under different circumstances in other cities. One brochure
                describes its Aims and Current Accomplishments and another, A
                National Demonstration Project, 1998-2002, contains an account
                of its establishment.
