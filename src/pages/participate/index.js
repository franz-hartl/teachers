            <p>The Institute accepts as Fellows teachers of English, history, languages, arts, science, and mathematics from New Haven's public elementary and secondary schools. Interested teachers discuss their potential eligibility with a School Representative or a Steering Committee member who works closely with those teachers who then submit an online application.
